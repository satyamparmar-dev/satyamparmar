# üöÄ Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Corrected Base Path Configuration

### 4. ‚úÖ Added GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Fixed**: Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for automated deployment
- **Fixed**: Proper permissions and artifact handling for GitHub Pages

### 5. ‚úÖ Updated Repository References
- **Fixed**: Updated all GitHub repository URLs to use correct name
- **Fixed**: Updated deployment scripts to use correct repository

## üöÄ How to Deploy

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Push your changes to the `main` branch
2. Go to your repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
3. Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. The workflow will automatically deploy on every push

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy using the script
npm run deploy
```

### Option 3: Using the batch file (Windows)
```bash
deploy-simple.bat
```

## üîß Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with your configuration:

```bash
# GitHub Pages Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://satyamparmar-dev.github.io/backend-engineering
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Backend Engineering Blog

# Email Services (Choose one)
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_id

# Formspree Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID=your_form_id
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set up Email Services**:
   - For Newsletter: Use EmailJS or Mailchimp
   - For Contact Form: Use Formspree

2. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   - Push to main branch (GitHub Actions will handle deployment)
   - Or use manual deployment scripts

## üåê Your Site URL
After deployment, your site will be available at:
`https://satyamparmar-dev.github.io/backend-engineering`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **API Routes**: Newsletter and contact form APIs won't work on GitHub Pages (static hosting)
- **Email Services**: You need to set up third-party services (EmailJS, Formspree, etc.)
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure to set up your email service credentials
- **Build Process**: The site now builds as a static export, which is compatible with GitHub Pages

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you still see blank screens:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the base path is correct in `next.config.js`
3. Ensure all assets are loading from the correct path
4. Check that the build completed successfully
5. Verify GitHub Pages is configured to use the `gh-pages` branch

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify your repository settings
3. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
