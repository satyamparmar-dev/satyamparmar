Use Indexes Wisely\n\nAlways ensure your frequently queried columns have proper indexes. However, avoid over-indexing as it can slow down write operations.\n\n### 2. Limit Results\n\nUse `LIMIT` clauses to restrict the number of rows returned, especially for pagination:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;\n```\n\n### 3. Avoid SELECT *\n\nOnly select the columns you actually need:\n\n```sql\n-- Instead of\nSELECT * FROM products;\n\n-- Use\nSELECT id, name, price FROM products;\n```\n\n### 4. Use Prepared Statements\n\nPrepared statements not only prevent SQL injection but also improve performance through query caching.\n\n## Quick Wins\n\n- Add indexes to foreign keys\n- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query plans\n- Monitor slow query logs regularly\n- Consider connection pooling\n\nStay tuned for more daily tips!\n"
