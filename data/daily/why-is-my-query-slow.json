The Real Culprit\\n3. Smart Indexing in the Real World\\n4. Real-World Truth\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\nWhy is my query slow? This is a question almost every backend developer ends up asking sooner or later.\\n\\nYou deploy a new feature. Everything works perfectly in staging. But once it reaches production, that simple SELECT * query suddenly causes the system to slow down.\\n\\nThis situation happens more often than most people realize. The reason usually lies deep inside the way the database handles indexes.\\n\\n## 2. The Real Culprit\\nThe most common reason for slow queries is missing or incorrect database indexes.\\n\\nIndexes are used to speed up how data is retrieved from tables. They work like an index in a book, helping the database find the right rows faster. However, indexes are not always a free performance boost.\\n\\nWhen you create an index, every time a row is inserted, updated, or deleted, the index must also be updated. This extra work means that while read queries may become faster, write operations can slow down.\\n\\nSo, adding more indexes does not always mean better performance. The right balance depends on your data access patterns.\\n\\n## 3. Smart Indexing in the Real World\\nHere are some practical steps to make indexing efficient:\\n\\n- Index only the columns that are used often in queries. Do not index every column.\\n- Use composite indexes for queries that filter on more than one column, such as user_id and status.\\n- Avoid using SELECT * in queries. Fetch only the columns that you actually need.\\n- Use the EXPLAIN command to see how your database executes a query and whether it uses the indexes as expected.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can prevent unnecessary load and ensure that your queries stay fast even as your data grows.\\n\\n## 4. Real-World Truth\\nIn most cases, performance issues start at the query layer, not in the application code. A backend engineer who understands how SQL works and how data is accessed internally can identify and fix problems much faster.\\n\\nA good backend developer does not just write SQL queries that work; they understand why a query is slow and how to make it better.\n"}
